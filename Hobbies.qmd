# My Hobbies

![This is me playing the piano!](piano.jpg)

### Playing the piano
I've been playing the piano since I was 5-6 years old. At first I didn't like playing the piano, but as I played more and more, I slowly fell in love with it. I like playing the piano because of the tunes that I can make, the smile on people's face when I play a song that recognize, and it's just a great way to relax your mind. And I don't know about other people, but considering that I've been playing the piano for quite a long time, I consider myself quite good with the piano.

### Playing games
When I was a kid, I've always seen my older brother play games in his gameboy all the time and I always wondered why he always play games. One day, I tried playing some games on his gameboy and I was hooked. I slowly fell in love with how the game makes me think, and how I have to implement my thoughts to solve or pass the level. I have always been intrigued in how each games have different mechanics and requires different skills to beat the game. That's the reason why I really like playing games. I've been playing a lot of different games in my lifetime, so I would say I'm pretty good at playing games as well.

### Playing badminton
I've started playing badminton in grade 12. At first, I thought it was hard and that I wouldn't like playing these types of sports too much, but then I tried opening my mind to it, and what do you know? I became hooked into playing badminton as well. Badminton requires you to coordinate your body and think about how you can hit the shuttlecock back at them as well as your positioning while hitting the shuttlecock to make sure that they would be in a disadvantage after you hit the shuttlecock back at them. The challenge of coordination, thinking, and implementing your thoughts into actions, are what made me love playing badminton. However, I haven't been playing badminton for a while, so I wouldn't say I'm good at it. I would say I'm decent at playing badminton.
